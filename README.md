# Quadratic Equations Solver

module realizes a function for finding solutions of quadratic equations

# How to use

You should import the function into your code

```
from quadratic_equation import get_roots
a = 1
b = -2
c = 1
root1, root2 = get_roots(a, b, c)
```

# Auto-tests

There is an autotest realization. The code has been checked every time before commit.


# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
